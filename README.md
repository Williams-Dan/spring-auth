# Spring Auth

This is a very simple library for providing a spring boot application with OAuth2 type authentication, while taking a lot of influence from spring security it is not meant as a spring security replacement but rather a light weight alternative


## Build Status
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/eetchyza/spring-auth.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/eetchyza/spring-auth)

## Getting Started

Import the library into your spring boot project via maven:

``` xml
TBC

```
Then you will need to make sure your spring boot application scans for 'com.eetchyza.springauth'

``` java
@SpringBootApplication(scanBasePackages = {"com.eetchyza.demo", "io.github.eetchyza.springauth"})
public class Application {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
	}
}

```
Include this bean in your java configs

``` java
    @Bean
    public SecurityFilter securityFilter(){
        return new SecurityFilter();
    }

```

Next there are two interfaces you will need to implement both of these should then be mapped to your data store and domain objects

``` java

@Entity
public class Authority implements GrantedAuthority {

    @Column
    private String name;

    public Authority() {

    }

    public Authority(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    @Override
    public String getAuthority() {
        return name;
    }
}

@Entity
public class User implements UserDetails {
    @Column(unique = true)
    private String username;
    @Column
    private String password;
    @Column(unique = true)
    private String emailAddress;
    @OneToMany(cascade = CascadeType.MERGE, fetch = FetchType.EAGER)
    @JoinTable(name = "user_roles",
            joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "user_id"),
            inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "role_id"))
    private List<Authority> authorities;
    @Column
    private boolean temporaryPassword;
    @Column
    private LocalDateTime expires;
    
    ...

```

Finally the library needs to be able to access users from your data store, to do this you will need implement the user details service and mark it with @Service to make sure spring picks it up.

``` java 

@Service
public class UserQueryService implements UserDetailsService {

    @Override
    public User loadUserByUsername(String username){
        // Fetch user from data store in here
    }
}

```

At this point your spring boot application should be all set up with spring auth and ready to go.

## Usage

Once integrated into your spring boot project it should be pretty straight forward to use.
All endpoints will automatically return 403 unless annotated with either `@AllowAnon` or `@AllowRoles`, the first simply lets the request continue without authorising while the second will only allow requests from users with `GrantedAuthorities`  that have names matching the provided strings.

For all requests there should be a 'TOKEN' header set with a valid authentication token or the requests will be rejected.
These tokens can be retrived and refreshed (as they expire) with the [below](https://github.com/Williams-Dan/spring-auth/#login) endpoints.

**NOTE:** When saving a user the password needs to be hashed and salted with `AuthService#hashAndSalt`
